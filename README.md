# slider
 This is a simple Django gallery app, whereby images are being pulled from the database and displayed dynamically (programatically).
 image-slider images are uploaded trough the admin portal Rather than the stressfull hard-codiing HTML method of displaying images in a 
 courosel and having to hardcode an image in the source code eachtime there is a need to add a new image.
